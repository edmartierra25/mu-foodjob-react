## Asking Questions

For how-to questions and other non-issues, please use [Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a79019dc124254588919e098c7ad1307c%40thread.tacv2/topic-mux?groupId=80be72e5-1fa7-4481-9641-9973ba3639f2&tenantId=5d3e2773-e07f-4432-a630-1a0f68a28a05) - you can find us in the **#topic-mux** channel.

## Opening an Issue

If you think you have found a bug, or have a new feature idea, please start by making sure it hasn't already been [reported or fixed](https://github.com/manulife-innersource/mux-vite-template/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed). You can search through existing issues and PRs to see if someone has reported one similar to yours.

Next, create a new issue using one of the provided issue templates that briefly explains the problem, and provides a bit of background as to the circumstances that triggered it, and steps to reproduce it.

For code issues please include:

- MUX version
- React version
- MUX template version
- A code example or link to a repo, [MUX Sandbox](https://mux.manulife.com/sandbox) or running site.

For visual or layout problems, please include relevant images, animated gifs, or videos that can help explain your issue.

### Issue Guidelines

- Please use a succinct description ("doesn't work" doesn't help others find similar issues).
- Use the appropriate issue template (`Bug` / `Feature` / `Question`) and fill in all sections as best you can.
- Please don't group multiple topics into one issue, each should be its own issue.
- Please don't just comment "+1" on an issue. It spams the maintainers and doesn't help move the issue forward. Use GitHub "reactions" instead.
